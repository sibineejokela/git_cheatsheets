TIPS FOR BACKTRACKING:

defn: HEAD commit		- commit that you're currently on
git show HEAD 			- displays what git log would show for HEAD commit AND
				  file changes that were committed
git checkout HEAD file.txt	- restores file.txt in wd to be identical to how it was
				  when last commit was made
				  shortcut: git checkout -- file.txt
git reset HEAD file.txt		- unstages file.txt (does NOT discard changes made to 
				  file.txt in wd)
git reset [commit_SHA]		- commit_SHA should be the first 7 characters of previous
				  commit's SHA (found with git log); resets to that commit
				  AKA makes HEAD the commit with specified SHA


COMMITTING WITH EXCESS TEXT. SENDING TO GITHUB WILL TEST RESET W SHA

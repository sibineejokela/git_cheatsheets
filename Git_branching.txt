COMMANDS FOR BRANCHING:

Local:
git branch			- output * indicates what branch you're on 
git branch branch_name		- create a new branch 
git checkout branch_name	- switch to different branch

git merge branch_name		- merge branch_name (giver branch) into master (receiver branch);
				  NOTE: git checkout master to be on master during merge
    Fast-forward		- if most recent commit is on giver branch, Git fast-forwards
				  master up-to-date with giver branch
git branch -d branch_name	- delete branch_name 
				  NOTE: use -D if branch deleted wasn't merged


Remote:
git merge origin/branch_name	- merge branch_name FROM remote (GitHub)
NOTE:				- delete branches remotely under "branches" tab


   Remote Workflow (suggested):
	1. Create branch locally (git branch branch-1)
	2. Push local branch to remote (git push origin branch-1)
	3. Create/submit a pull request (PR) ("New PR" on Github, eg)
	   This merges branch-1 into the origin/master
	4. Merge remote master into local master (git fetch origin & get merge origin)


----------------------------

MERGE CONFLICT:
1. Commit on branch and master and try to merge them.
   
   Resolve: 
   Git markings for conflict to be fixed:	
	<<<<<<< HEAD
	master version of file
	=======
	branch_name version of file
	>>>>>>> branch_name
   To resolve conflict, delete unwanted version AND ALL MARKINGS (<<,==,>>)
   Restage, recommit.

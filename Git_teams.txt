COLLABORATING IN GIT:


Defn: remote				- shared Git repository that multiple people can 
					  work on at the same time
git clone remote_location clone_name	- Git copies everything from remote_location to
					  local clone_name directory
					+ remote_location: where the the remote can be 
					  found by Git (file path, web address, etc)
					+ clone_name: your directory name where the 
					  repository will be cloned by Git
git remote -v				- lists remotes of a Git project;
					  remote automatically named origin (can be changed)
git fetch				- bring Git project changes to local copy - remote branch
					  (will NOT merge changes into local repository - master branch)
git merge origin/master			- merges changes from origin/master to local master branch 
git push origin your_branch_name	- push your branch to remote origin 
					  (where others can review changes)



Git Collaborative Workflow:
	1. From remote, fetch and merge changes (git fetch, git merge origin/master)
	2. Create branch locally (git branch branch-1) and commit changes
	3. Fetch and merge again (from remote; in case of new commits)
	4. Push local branch to remote (git push origin branch-1)
	5. Create/submit a pull request (PR) ("New PR" on Github, eg)
	   Collaborator: merges branch-1 into the origin/master
	6. REPEAT:...Merge remote master into local master (git fetch origin & get merge origin)
